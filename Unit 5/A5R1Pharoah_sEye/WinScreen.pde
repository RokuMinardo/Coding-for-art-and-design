//Was trying to add a class for the winScreen but it came to a failed attempt
//I also tried to add a regular function in draw but failed again
//This is probably becasue at this moment I'm almost done and now mind is scrambled
//Will add it when I work on it after class just for fun


//class WinScreen {
  
 // WinScreen() {
    
    
 // }
//display win screen
//void displayWinScreen(String winner) {
  //fill(0);
  //textSize(10);
  //textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
  //text(winner+ "Victory!", width / 2, height / 2);
//}
//}
